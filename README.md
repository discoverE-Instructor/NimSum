# NimSum

Nim Sum is also called the take away game. The game initially starts with a single pile of objects. In our case, we will be using marbles. There are two players. Each player takes turns taking either 1, 2, or 3 marbles from the pile. In this case the second player is just the program. The player that picks up the last marble is the loser!
